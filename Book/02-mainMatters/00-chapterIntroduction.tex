\section*{The Editing strategy}
\label{sec:0.1}

The numerous listings shown in the following chapters, are all checked with the \texttt{doctest} module of the standard Python3 library and should work effectively as such either, in a shell \texttt{python3} console, or for sure in an \texttt{ipython} console. Some chapters will rely on a given data file that are made available in the \texttt{examples} directory of the \Digraph resources.
