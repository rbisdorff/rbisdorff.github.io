\section{The editing strategy}
%\label{sec:0.1}

In this book we present series of tutorials and advanced topics originally written as documentation parts for the \Digraph collection of Python ressources over the last ten years \citep{BIS-2021}. These \Digraph resources, like the \texttt{outrankingDigraphs} module were essentially used for the preparation and illustration of the MICS Algoritmic Decision Theory Course taught at the University of Luxembourg from 2010-2020. Some parts also served for preparing and illustrating the lectures of a MICS Computational Statistics Course like the \texttt{randomNumbers} module. Curious readers will also discover some resources like the \texttt{arithmetics} module, used for preparing and illustrating a first Semester Cours on Discrete Mathematics.

The numerous listings shown in the following chapters, are all checked with the \texttt{doctest} module of the standard Python3 library and should work effectively as such either, in a shell \texttt{python3} console, or for sure in an \texttt{ipython} console. Some chapters will rely on a given data file that are made available in the \texttt{examples} directory of the \Digraph resources. 

\section{Organisation of the book}
% \label{sec:0.2}

\noindent The book is organised into five parts. Part I presents three chapters introducing the \Digraph resources and the main formal objects discussed in this book, namely \emph{bipolar-valued digraphs} and, in particular, \emph{outranking digraphs}.

Part II illustrates in eight chapters decision methods and tools and performance evaluation models. These methodological chapters are mostly problem oriented and show how to build a best choice recommendation or compute the winner of an election. Others show how to linearly rank or order incommensurable multiple criteria performance records. We also show how to rate such performance records with order-statistical quantiles.

Part III, with four chapters, presents three case studies: --one for building a best choice recommendation for selecting a study program, --one for ranking world famous Computer Science Dpts, and --a third one for rating the student recruitment quality of German Universities. The three case studies are followed by a set of exercises suitable for a Course on Algorithmic Decision Theory.

Part IV presents in five chapters more advanced topics showing some pearls of bipolar-valued epistemic logic. We first generalize \Kendall 's ordinal correlation index to bipolar-valued digraphs in order to measure the fitness of our ranking results. A second and important advanced topic concerns the effective computation of digraph kernels and solving of \Berge kernel equation systems. We furthermore introduce confidence levels for outranking situations when facing uncertain criteria significance weights. And, we develop a robustness analysis of the outranking digraph when facing only ordinal criteria significance weights. The last topic concerns the tempering of plurality tyranny effects in social choice problems with the help a.o. of bipolar approval voting. 

Part V, with three chapters, concerns eventually simple undirected graphs and illustrates operational resources for working with such graphs, like \emph{q-coloring}, enumerating\emph{ maximal independent sets} (MISs) and \emph{cliques}, computing \emph{maximal matchings}, simulating \emph{Metropolis random walks} and enumerating the \emph{non-isomorphic} MISs of the $n$-cycle graph. A second chapter is more specifically devoted to \emph{tree graphs} and \emph{graph forests}. A very last chapter, inspired by Martin Golumbic â€˜s book on \emph{Algorithmic Graph Theory and Perfect Graphs}, introduces \emph{split}, \emph{interval} and \emph{permutation} graphs.
