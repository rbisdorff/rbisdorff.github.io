12-chapterAliceChoice.tex:91:The actual evaluations of Alice's potential study programs are stored in a file named \texttt{AliceChoice.py} of \texttt{PerformanceTableau} format Footnote[21].
12-chapterAliceChoice.tex:131:Alice is subjectively evaluating the \emph{Attractiveness} of the studies (criterion $AS$) on an ordinal scale from 0 (weak) to 10 (excellent). Similarly, she is subjectively evaluating the \emph{Attractiveness} of the respective professions (criterion $AP$) on a three level ordinal scale from 0 (\emph{weak}), 1 (\emph{fair}) to 2 (\emph{good}). Considering the \emph{Occupational Prestige} (criterion $OP$), she looked up the SIOPS Footnote[20]. All the other evaluation data she found on the internet (see Fig. \ref{fig:12.3}).
12-chapterAliceChoice.tex:148:Her ten potential study programs are ordered with the \NetFlows ranking rule applied to the corresponding bipolar-valued outranking digraph Footnote[23]. \emph{Graduate interpreter} studies in Köln ($I-FHK$) or Saarbrücken ($I-USB$), followed by \emph{Qualified Translator} studies in Köln ($T-FHK$) appear to be Alice's most preferred alternatives. The least attractive study programs for her appear to be studies at the Chamber of Commerce of Köln ($C-HKK$, $S-HKK$).
14-chapterBestStudents.tex:6:\abstract{In 2004, the German magazine \emph{Der Spiegel}, with the help of \emph{McKinsey \& Company} and \emph{AOL}, conducted an extensive online survey, assessing the apparent quality of German University students Footnote[28]. More than 80,000 students, by participating, were questioned on their '\emph{Abitur}' and university exams' marks, time of studies and age, grants, awards and publications, IT proficiency, linguistic skills, practical work experience, foreign mobility and civil engagement. Each student received in return a quality score through a specific weighing of the collected data which depended on the subject the student is mainly studying. Footnote[29]. The eventually published results by the \emph{Spiegel} magazine concerned nearly 50,000 students, enroled in one of fifteen popular academic subjects, like \emph{German Studies}, \emph{Life Sciences}, \emph{Psychology}, \emph{Law}  or \emph{CS}. Publishing only those subject-University combinations, where at least 18 students had correctly filled in the questionnaire, left 41 German Universities where, for at least eight out of the fifteen subjects, an average enrolment quality score could be determined Footnote[29]. Based on this published data Footnote[28], we present and discuss in this chapter, how to \emph{rate} with the help of our \Digraph software ressources the apparent global \emph{enrolment quality} of these 41 higher education institutions.}
14-chapterBestStudents.tex:11:Published data of the 2004 \emph{Spiegel} student survey is stored, for our evaluation purpose here, in a file named \texttt{studentenSpiegel04.py} of \texttt{PerformanceTableau} format Footnote[32].
14-chapterBestStudents.tex:55:The evaluation of the individual quality score for a participating student actually depends on his or her mainly enroled subject Footnote[29]. The apparent quality measurement scales thus largely differ indeed from subject to subject (see Fig. \ref{fig:14.2}), like \emph{Law Studies} ($35.0 - 65-0$) and \emph{Politology} ($50.0 - 70.0$). The recorded average enrolment quality scores, hence, are in fact \emph{incommensurable} between the subjects.
14-chapterBestStudents.tex:59:The apparent incommensurability and very likely imprecision of the recorded average enrolment quality scores, renders meaningless any global averaging over the subjects per University of the enrolment quality. We shall therefore, similarly to the methodological approach of the \emph{Spiegel} authors Footnote[29], proceed with an \emph{order statistics} based rating-by-ranking approach (see Chapter \ref{sec:10} on rating with learned quantile norms).
14-chapterBestStudents.tex:64:The \emph{Spiegel} authors opted indeed for a simple 3-tiling of the Universities per valuated academic subject, followed by an average \Borda scores based global ranking Footnote[29]. Here, our epistemic logic based outranking approach, allows us, with adequate choices of \emph{indifference} ($0.1$) and \emph{preference} ($0.5$) discrimination thresholds, to estimate \emph{lower-closed} 9-tiles of the enrolment quality scores per subject and rank conjointly, with the help of the \Copeland ranking rule Footnote[34] applied to a corresponding bipolar-valued outranking digraph, the 41 Universities \textbf{and} the lower limits of the estimated 9-tiles limits.
14-chapterBestStudents.tex:124:The ordinal correlation ($+0.967$) Footnote[35] of the \Copeland ranking with the underlying bipolar-valued outranking digraph is very high (see Fig. \ref{fig:14.4} Row 1). Most correlated subjects with this rating-by-ranking result appear to be \emph{German Studies} ($+0.51$), \emph{Chemistry} ($+0.48$), \emph{Management} ($+0.47$) and \emph{Physics} ($+0.46$). Both \emph{Electrical} ($+0.07$) and \emph{Mechanical Engineering} ($+0.05$) are the less correlated subjects (see Row 3).
14-chapterBestStudents.tex:280: Here we observe indeed 93 such outranking circuits, like: Berlin Humboldt $>$ Konstanz $>$ München $>$ Berlin Humboldt, supported by a $(0.133 + 1.0)/2 = 56.7\%$ majority of subjects Footnote[31] (see circuit 29 above). In the \Copeland ranking result shown in Fig. \ref{fig:14.4}, these Universities appear positioned respectively at ranks 10, 4 and 6. In the \NetFlows ranking result they would appear respectively at ranks 10, 6 and 5, thus inverting the positions of Konstanz and München. The occurrence in digraph $dg$ of so many outranking circuits makes thus \emph{doubtful} any \emph{forced} linear ranking, independently of the specific ranking rule we might have applied.
14-chapterBestStudents.tex:335:In the 9-tiles sorting result, shown in Listing \ref{list:14.6}, we notice for instance in Lines 3-4 that the RWTH Aachen is precisely rated into the 4th 9-tile ($[0.33 - 0.44[$), whereas the University Augsburg is less precisely rated conjointly into the $6^{th}$, the $7^{th}$ and the $8^{th}$ 9-tile ($[0.56 - 0.89[$). In Line 42, TU München appears best rated into the unique highest 9-tile ($[0.89 - <[$). All three rating results are supported by a $(0.07 + 1.0)/2 = 53.5\%$ majority of valuated subjects Footnote[31]. With the support of a $76.5\%$ majority of valuated subjects (Line 20), the apparent most confident rating result is the one of University Freiburg (see also Fig. \ref{fig:3} and Fig. \ref{fig:14.4}). 
15-chapterExercises.tex:89:\subsection{Data Footnote[43]}
15-chapterExercises.tex:142:\item File \texttt{perfTab\_1.py} [Footnote] contains a 3 Objectives performance tableau with 100 performance records concerning public policies evaluated with respect to an \emph{economic}, a \emph{societal} and an \emph{environmental} public decision objective.
16-chapterCorrelation.tex:15:Let us consider such a performance tableau in file \texttt{graffiti07.py} Footnote[] gathering a Movie Magazine's rating of some movies that could actually be seen in town Footnote[1] (see Fig. \ref{fig:16.1}).
16-chapterCorrelation.tex:350:To get a picture of the actual divergence of rating opinions concerning jointly seen pairs of movies, we may develop a Principal Component Analysis Footnote[2] of the corresponding $\tau$ correlation matrix. The 3D plot of the first 3 principal axes is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:16.2}.
16-chapterCorrelation.tex:397:Such a preordering of the movies may, for instance, be computed with the \texttt{computeRankingByChoosing()} method, where we iteratively extract dominant kernels --best remaining choices-- and absorbent kernels --worst remaining choices-- (see the next Chapter). We operate therefore on the asymmetric ``\emph{better rated than}'' opinions, i.e. the codual (Footnote[3]) of the ``\emph{at least as well rated as}'' opinions (see Listing \ref{list:16.9} Line 2).
17-chapterKernels.tex:250:It is worth noticing that the dual version (Footnote[14]) of a weak circuit corresponds to its \emph{converse} version, i.e. $-c6$ = $\sim c6$ (see Fig. \ref{fig:17.4}).
17-chapterKernels.tex:268:It is worthwhile noticing that weak chordless circuits of length $n$ are in fact part of the class of digraphs that are invariant under the \emph{codual} transform, $cn = - (\sim cn) = \sim (-cn )$ Footnote [13]. In the case, now, of an odd weak chordless circuit, neither the weak chordless circuit, nor its dual, converse, or codual versions will admit any initial or terminal prekernels. 
17-chapterKernels.tex:568:Finally, we use our bipolar epistemic logic framework for computing the credibility that an individual node of the digraph fits with being a member of an initial or terminal prekerenel. For this purpose we make use of the \Berge kernel equation systems Footnote[x][BER-1958p].
18-chapterConfidentOutrankings.tex:71:A \emph{Monte Carlo} simulation with $10\,000$ runs empirically confirms the effective convergence to a Gaussian (see Fig. \ref{fig:18.3} realised with \emph{gretl} Footnote[4]).
20-chapterMultipartisan.tex:190:In Listing \ref{list:20.6} below we generate such a divisive kind of linear voting profile with the help of the \texttt{DivisivePolitics} flag  Footnote[5] (see Lines 4 and 13-19). When now converting the voting profile into a performance tableau (Lines 20-21), we may compute the corresponding unopposed outranking digraph.
21-chapterTemperingPlurality.tex:17:File \texttt{bpApVotingProfile.py} Footnote[x] contains such a bipolar approval voting profile concerning 100 voters and 15 eligible candidates. We may inspect its content as follows.
22-chapterGraphs.tex:14:\item \texttt{edges} : a dictionary with \emph{frozensets} Footnote[x] of pairs of vertices as entries carrying a characteristic value in the range of the previous valuation domain,

22-chapterGraphs.tex:217:A MIS in the dual of a graph instance $g$ (its dual $-g$ Footnote[14]), corresponds to a maximal \emph{clique}, i.e. a maximal complete subgraph in $g$. Maximal cliques may be directly enumerated with the \texttt{showCliques()} method.
23-chapterTreeGraphs.tex:219:In case of valued graphs supporting weighted edges, we may finally construct a \emph{most determined} spanning tree (or forest if not connected) using \Kruskal's greedy minimum-spanning-tree algorithm Footnote[5] on the dual valuation of the graph [KRU-1956].
24-chapterIsomorphicMIS.tex:62:In the 12-cycle graph, we observe 29 labelled MISs: 3 of cardinality 4, 24 of cardinality 5, and 2  of cardinality 6. In case of n-cycle graphs with $n$ > 20, as the cardinality of the MISs becomes big, it is preferable to use the shell \texttt{perrinMIS} command compiled from C and installed Footnote[3] along with all the Digraphs3 python modules for computing the set of MISs observed in the graph.
24-chapterIsomorphicMIS.tex:119:For computing the corresponding non isomorphic MISs, we actually need the automorphism group of the c12-cycle graph. The \texttt{Digraph} class therefore provides the \texttt{automorphismGenerators()} method which adds automorphism group generators to a \texttt{Digraph} class instance with the help of the external shell \texttt{dreadnaut} command from the \emph{nauty} software package Footnote[2].
25-chapterPerfectGraphs.tex:95:Suppose the file \texttt{berge.py} Footnote[18] contains the following \texttt{Graph} instance data:
