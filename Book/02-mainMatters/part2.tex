  \part{Evaluation models and decision methods and tools}

  \begin{quotation}''... whether we are deciding between buying different commodity baskets, or making choices about what to do on a holiday, or deciding for whom to vote for in an election, we are inescapably involved in evaluating alternatives with nonâ€“commensurable aspects.''
    
    --Amartya Sen\index{Sen@\textsl{A. Sen}} \emph{Idea of Justice}, Allen Lane London, 2009.
  \end{quotation}

  \noindent The second and main Part of the book presents in eight chapters decision methods and computational tools for selecting a best decision alternative, for ranking the potential decision alternative from best to worst, for relative and absolute rating with the help of bipolar-valued outranking digraphs. We also show how to edit a new multiple criteria performance tableau and present several models of random performance tableau generators. A last chapter is devoted to HPC ranking of big performance tableaux.
