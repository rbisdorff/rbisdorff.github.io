  \part{Evaluation models and decision methods and tools}

  \begin{quotation}
“... The goal of our research was to design a resolution method ... that is easy to put into practice, that requires as few and reliable hypotheses as possible, and that meets the needs [of the decision maker]...” --\citep*{ROY-1966}\index{Roy@\textsl{B. Roy}}.
\end{quotation}

  \vspace{1cm}
  \noindent The second and main Part of the book presents in eight chapters decision methods and computational tools for selecting a best decision alternative, for ranking the potential decision alternative from best to worst, for relative and absolute rating with the help of bipolar-valued outranking digraphs. We also show how to edit a new multiple criteria performance tableau and present several models of random performance tableau generators. A last chapter is devoted to HPC ranking of big performance tableaux.
