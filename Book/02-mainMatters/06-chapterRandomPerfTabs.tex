\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:6.1}

The \texttt{randomPerfTabs} module\index{randomPerfTabs@\texttt{randomPerfTabs} module} provides several classes for generating random performance tableaux models of different kind, mainly for the purpose of testing implemented methods and tools presented and discussed in the Algorithmic Decision Theory course lectures at the University of Luxembourg. This chapter introduces several of these performance tableau models.

The simplest generic class, called \texttt{RandomPerformanceTableau}, generates a set of $n$ decision actions, a family of $m$ real-valued performance criteria, ranging by default from $0.0$ to $100.0$, associated with default discrimination thresholds: $2.5$ (\texttt{ind}), $5.0$ (\texttt{pref}) and $60.0$ (\texttt{veto}). The generated random evaluations are by default \texttt{Beta(2,2)} distributed on each measurement scale.

One of the most useful models, called \texttt{RandomCBPerformanceTableau}\index{}, proposes a performance tableau involving two decision objectives, named \emph{Costs} (to be minimised) respectively \emph{Benefits} (to be maximised); its purpose being to generate more or less contradictory performances on these two, usually conflicting, objectives. \emph{Low costs} will randomly be correlated with \emph{low benefits}, whereas \emph{high costs} will randomly be correlated with \emph{high benefits}.

Many public policy decision problems involve three often conflicting decision objectives taking into account \emph{economical}, \emph{societal} as well as \emph{environmental} aspects. For this type of performance tableau model, the \texttt{randomPerfTabs} module provides a specific class, called \texttt{Random3ObjectivesPerformanceTableau}.

Deciding which students, based on their grades obtained in a number of examinations, validate or not their academic studies, is the genuine decision practice of universities and academies. To thoroughly study these kind of decision problems, the \texttt{randomPerfTabs} module provides a corresponding performance tableau model, called \texttt{RandomAcademic\-PerformanceTableau}, which gathers grades obtained by a given number of students in a given number of weighted courses.    
 
\section{Random standard performance tableaux}
\label{sec:6.2}
    
The \texttt{RandomPerformanceTableau} class\index{RandomPerformanceTableau@\texttt{RandomPerformance\-Tab\-leau} class}, the simplest of the kind, specialises the generic \texttt{PerformanceTableau} class, and takes the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm,rightmargin=0.5cm]
\item \texttt{numberOfActions} := number of decision actions.
\item \texttt{numberOfCriteria} := number of performance criteria.
\item \texttt{weightDistribution} := \\
   \texttt{'random'} (default) $|$ \texttt{'fixed'} $|$ \texttt{'equisignificant'}:
      \begin{itemize}[rightmargin=1cm,topsep=1pt]
         \item If \texttt{'random'}, weights are uniformly selected randomly from the given weight scale;
         \item If \texttt{'fixed'}, the weightScale must provided a corresponding weights distribution;
         \item If \texttt{'equi-significant'}, all criterion weights are put to unity.
      \end{itemize}
\item \texttt{weightScale} := \texttt{[Min,Max]} (default =(1, \texttt{numberOfCriteria}).
\item \texttt{IntegerWeights} := \texttt{True} (default) $|$ \texttt{False} (normalised to proportions of $1.0$).
\item \texttt{commonScale} := \texttt{[a,b]}; common performance measuring scales (default = $[0.0,100.0]$)
\item \texttt{commonThresholds} := [(\texttt{q0}, \texttt{q1}), (\texttt{p0}, \texttt{p1}), (\texttt{v0}, \texttt{v1})]; indifference(\texttt{q}), preference (\texttt{p}) and considerable performance difference (\texttt{v}) discrimination thresholds. For each threshold type $x \in \{\mathtt{q},\mathtt{p},\mathtt{v}\}$, the float $x0$ value represents a \emph{constant percentage} of the common scale and the float $x1$ value a \emph{proportional value} of the actual performance measure. Default values are $[(2.5.0,0.0), (5.0,0.0), (60.0,0,0)]$. 
\item \texttt{commonMode} := common distribution of random performance measurements\footnote{See Lecture 3 of the Computational Statistic Course \citep{CPSTAT-L3}.}:
      \begin{itemize}[rightmargin=1cm]
         \item (\texttt{'beta'}, \texttt{None} (default setting), ($\alpha$, $\beta$)), a beta generator with default $\alpha=2$ and $\beta=2$ parameters.
         \item  (\texttt{'uniform'}, \texttt{None}, \texttt{None}), uniformly distributed float values on the given common scales' range \texttt{[Min, Max]};
         \item (\texttt{'normal'}, $\mu$, $\sigma$), truncated Gaussian distribution, by default $\mu = (b-a)/2$ and $\sigma = (b-a)/4$;
         \item (\texttt{'triangular'}, \emph{mode}, \emph{repartition}), generalised triangular distribution with a probability repartition parameter specifying the probability mass accumulated until the mode value. By default, \emph{mode} = $(b-a)/2$ and \texttt{repartition} = $0.5$.\footnote{The \texttt{randomNumbers} module provides for this purpose the \texttt{ExtendedTriangular\-RandomVariable} class\index{ExtendedTriangularRandomVariable@\texttt{ExtendedTriangularRandom\-Variable} class}.}
      \end{itemize}
\item \texttt{valueDigits} := \texttt{integer}, precision of performance measurements (2 decimal digits by default).
\item \texttt{missingDataProbability} := $0.0 \leq \mathtt{float} \leq 1.0$ ; probability of missing performance evaluation on a criterion for an alternative (default $0.025$).
\item \texttt{NA} := \texttt{Decimal} (default = $-999$); missing data symbol. \end{itemize} 

\noindent \textbf{Code example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Generating a random performance tableau},label=list:6.1]

Best and worst evaluation on each criterion are marked in \emph{light green}, respectively in \emph{light red}. Notice that missing (\texttt{NA}) evaluations are recorded in a performance tableau by default as \texttt{Decimal('-999')} value (see List.~\vref{list:6.1} Lines~\ref{line:6.1.28}-\ref{line:6.1.29}).	    

\section{Random Cost-Benefit performance tableaux}
\label{sec:6.3}

The \texttt{randomPerfTabs} module provides a \texttt{RandomCBPerformanceTableau} class\index{RandomCBPerformanceTableau@\texttt{RandomCBPerformanceTab\-leau} class} for generating \emph{Costs} versus \emph{Benefits} organised performance tableaux. The random generator is following by default the directives below:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm,rightmargin=0.25cm]
\item Three types of decision actions are distinguished: \emph{cheap}, \emph{neutral} and \emph{expensive} ones with an equal proportion of 1/3. Two types of weighted criteria are also distinguished: \emph{Costs} criteria to be \emph{minimised}, and \emph{Benefits} criteria to be \emph{maximised}, in the proportions 1/3 respectively 2/3;
\item  Random performances on each type of criteria  are drawn, either from an ordinal scale $[0;10]$, or from a cardinal scale $[0.0;100.0]$, following a parametric triangular law of mode: $30\%$ performance for cheap, $50\%$ for neutral, and $70\%$ performance for expensive decision actions, with constant probability repartition $0.5$ on each side of the respective mode;
\item Costs criteria use mostly cardinal scales (3/4), whereas Benefits criteria use mostly ordinal scales (2/3); 
\item  The sum of weights of the Costs criteria equals by default the sum of weights of the Benefits criteria: \texttt{weighDistribution = 'equiobjectives'};
\item On cardinal criteria, both of cost or of benefit type, following constant performance discrimination quantiles are instantiated: $5\%$ indifferent situations, $90\%$ preference situations, and $5\%$ considerable performance difference situations. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Parameters}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm,rightmargin=0.5cm]
\item If \texttt{numberOfActions == None}, a uniform random number between 10 and 31 of \emph{cheap}, \emph{neutral} or \emph{advantageous} actions (equal 1/3 probability each type) actions is instantiated. Minimal number of decision actions required is 3; 
 \item If \texttt{numberOfCriteria == None}, a uniform random number between 5 and 21 of cost or benefit criteria (1/3 respectively 2/3 probability) is instantiated;
\item \texttt{weightDistribution} :=  \texttt{'equisignificant'} (default) $|$
 \texttt{'equi\-objectives'} $|$ \texttt{'fixed'} $|$ \texttt{'random'};
\item default \texttt{weightScale} for \texttt{'random'} weight distribution is 1 - \texttt{number\-OfCriteria};
\item All \emph{cardinal} criteria are evaluated with decimals between $0.0$ and $100.0$ whereas \emph{ordinal} criteria are evaluated with integers between 0 and 10.
\item \texttt{commonThresholds} is obsolete. Preference discrimination is specified as \emph{percentiles} of concerned performance differences (see below).
\item \texttt{commonPercentiles} := \texttt{\{'ind':5, 'pref':10, 'veto':95\}} are expressed in percents (reversed for vetoes), and only concern cardinal criteria.
\item \texttt{missingDataProbability} := $0.0 \leq \mathtt{float} \leq 1.0$ ; probability of missing performance evaluation on a criterion for an alternative (default $0.025$).
\item \texttt{NA} := \texttt{Decimal} (default = $-999$); missing data symbol. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Example Python session}:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Generating a random Cost-Benefit performance tableau},label=list:6.2]

\end{lstlisting}

In Listing~\vref{list:6.2} one may notice the three types of decision actions (see Lines~\ref{line:6.2.12}-\ref{line:6.2.22}), as well as the two types  of criteria with either an \emph{ordinal} or a \emph{cardinal} performance measuring scale (Lines~\ref{line:6.2.24}-\ref{line:6.2.35}). In the latter case, by default about $5\%$ of the random performance differences will be below the \emph{indifference} and $10\%$ below the \emph{preference} discriminating threshold. About $5\%$ will be \emph{considerably large}. More statistics about the generated performance evaluations can be inspected with the \texttt{showStatistics()} method.\index{showStatistics@\texttt{showStatistics()}}

\section{Random three objectives performance tableaux}
\label{sec:6.4}

The randomPerfTabs module provides a \texttt{Random3ObjectivesPerformance\-Tableau} class\index{Random3ObjectivesPerformanceTableau@\texttt{Random3ObjectivesPerformance\-Tableau} class} for generating random performance tableaux concerning public policies evaluated with respect to three decision objectives taking respectively into account \emph{economical}, \emph{societal} as well as \emph{environmental} aspects. Each potential public policy is qualified randomly as performing \emph{weak} ($-$), \emph{fair} ($\sim$) or \emph{good} ($+$) with respect to to each one of the three objectives. 

\noindent \textbf{Generator directives are the following:}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm,rightmargin=0.5cm]
\item \texttt{numberOfActions} = $20$ (default), minimal number required is 3; 
\item \texttt{numberOfCriteria} = $13$ (default),
\item \texttt{weightDistribution} = \texttt{'equiobjectives'} (default) $|$ \texttt{'random'} $|$ \texttt{'equisignificant'},
\item \texttt{weightScale} = (1,\texttt{numberOfCriteria}): only used when random criterion weights are requested,
\item \texttt{integerWeights} = \texttt{True} (default): \texttt{False} gives normalised rational weights, 
\item \texttt{commonScale} = ($0.0$,$100.0$),
\item \texttt{commonThresholds} = [$(5.0,0.0)$, $(10.0,0.0)$, $(60.0,0.0)$]: Performance discrimination thresholds may be set for \texttt{'ind'}, \texttt{'pref'} and \texttt{'veto'} thresholds,  
\item \texttt{commonMode} = [\texttt{'triangular'},\texttt{'variable'},$0.5$]: random number generators of various other types ('\emph{uniform}','\emph{beta}') are available. If the mode of the \texttt{'triangular'} distribution is set to \texttt{'variable'}, three modes at $0.3 (-)$, $0.5 (\sim)$, respectively $0.7 (+)$ of the common scale span are set at random for each coalition and action. 
\item \texttt{valueDigits} = 2 (default): evaluations are encoded as decimals,
\item \texttt{missingDataProbability} = $0.05$ (default): random insertion of missing values with given probability,  
\item \texttt{NA} := \texttt{Decimal} (default = \texttt{Decimal('-999')}; missing data symbol,
\item \texttt{seed} = \texttt{None} (default). 
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Example Python session:}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Generating a random 3 Objectives performance tableau},label=list:6.3]

...            Random3ObjectivesPerformanceTableau

\end{lstlisting}

The default missing data probablity is $5\%$. In our random instance here we observe $2.2\%$ of missing evaluations (see Line~\ref{line:6.3.16}). The '\texttt{equiobjectives}' directive results hence in a balanced total weight ($72.00$) for each decision objective (see Line~\ref{line:6.3.6}) as is made apparent below with the \texttt{showObjectives()} method\index{showObjectives@\texttt{showObjectives()}}.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Inspecting the three objectives},label=list:6.4]

    en10 criterion of objective Env 12
    Total weight: 72.00 (6 criteria)    §\label{line:6.4.21}§
\end{lstlisting}

In Listing~\vref{list:6.4}, we notice that four \emph{equisignificant} criteria (\texttt{ec01}, \texttt{ec05}, \texttt{ec06}, and \texttt{ec12}) of significance weight 18 assess, for instance, the performance of the public policies from an \emph{economic} point of view (Lines~\ref{line:6.4.3}-\ref{line:6.4.8}). Three \emph{equisignificant} criteria of weight 24 do the same from a \emph{societal} (Lines~\ref{line:6.4.9}-\ref{line:6.4.13}), and six of weight 12 from an \emph{environmental} point of view (Lines~\ref{line:6.4.14}-\ref{line:6.4.21}). 

Variable \emph{triangular} modes: $0.3$, $0.5$ or $0.7$ of the span of the measure scale, give a different performance status for each public policy with respect to the three decision objectives.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> t.showActions()
  key:  p1
   short name:  p1
   name:       action p1 Eco- Soc+ Env+
   profile:    {'Eco':'weak', 'Soc':'good', 'Env':'good'}
  key:  p2
   short name:  p2
   name:       action p2 Eco- Soc- Env-
   profile:    {'Eco':'weak', 'Soc':'weak', 'Env':'weak'}
   ...
  key:  p7
   short name:  p7
   name:       action p7 Eco+ Soc- Env-
   profile:    {'Eco':'good', 'Soc':'weak', 'Env':'weak'}
\end{lstlisting}

Policy \texttt{p1}, for instance, will probably show \emph{good} performances with respect to the \emph{societal} and \emph{environmental} aspects, and \emph{weak} performances with respect to the \emph{economical} aspect, whereas policy \texttt{p2}, weak with respect to to all the three objectives, will probably appear among the weakest policies.

We may inspect in Figure~\vref{fig:6.3} the given random three-objectives performance tableau with the \texttt{showHTMPerformanceTableau()} method\index{showHTMPerformanceTableau@\texttt{showHTMPerformanceTableau()}}.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> t.showHTMLPerformanceTableau()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}

Light green cells show the highest and light red the lowest evaluations. Policy \texttt{p1} shows thus the weakest performance ($17.09/100.00$) on the environmental criterion \texttt{en09}, whereas policy \texttt{p3} shows the best performances on four out of the six \emph{environmental} criteria.

No trivial best choice becomes apparent when looking at the performance tableau shown in Figure~\vref{fig:6.3}. Let us therefore compute a \Rubis best choice recommendation (see Chapter~\vref{sec:4}).
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={What is the public policy to recommend as best choice ?},label=list:6.5]

\end{lstlisting}

Policy \texttt{p3} gives the most credible best choice recommendation with the support of a $57.5\%$ majority of significance, whereas policy \texttt{p7} gives a credible last choice recommendation . Policy \texttt{p5} represents an ambiguous first and last choice candidate. A drawing of the strict outranking digraph oriented by first and last choices shows in Figure~\vref{fig:6.4} the complete preferential picture.

A heatmap view on the \Copeland ranked performance tableau confirms the best choice recommendation (see Section~\vref{sec:8.2}).

The heatmap view with its \Copeland ranking based on the bipolar outranking digraph confirms policy's \texttt{p3} as first-ranked. Notice also that the three strict outranked policies do effectively appear in the last positions.

\section{Random academic performance tableaux}
\label{sec:6.5}

The \texttt{RandomAcademicPerformanceTableau} class\index{RandomAcademicPerformanceTableau@\texttt{RandomAcademicPerformance\-Tableau} class} generates performance tableaux with random grades for a given number of students in different courses. 

\noindent \textbf{Generator directives:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm,rightmargin=0.5cm,topsep=3pt]
\item \texttt{numberOfStudents} := \texttt{Integer} (default 10)
\item \texttt{numberOfCourses} := \texttt{Integer} (default 5)
\item \texttt{weightDistribution} := '\emph{equisignificant}' | '\emph{random}' (default),
\item \texttt{weightScale} := $1$, $1$ - \texttt{numberOfCourses} (default when random)),
\item \texttt{IntegerWeights} := \texttt{Boolean} (True = default),
\item \texttt{commonScale} := (\texttt{Integer},\texttt{integer}) $(0,20)$ (default),
\item \texttt{ndigits} := \texttt{Integer} (default 0),
\item \texttt{WithTypes} := \texttt{Boolean} (default False),
\item \texttt{commonMode} := ('\texttt{triangular}',$xm$=14,$r$=0.25) (default),
\item \texttt{commonThresholds} := {\texttt{'ind'}:(0,0), \texttt{'pref'}:(1,0)} (default),
\item \texttt{missingDataProbability} := 0.0 (default),
\item \texttt{NA} := \texttt{Decimal} (default = $-999$); missing data symbol. 
\end{itemize}      

When Parameter \texttt{WithTypes} is set to \texttt{True}, the students are randomly allocated to one of the following four categories --\texttt{weak} (1/6), \texttt{fair} (1/3), \texttt{good} (1/3), and \texttt{excellent} (1/3)-- in the bracketed proportions. In a default $0-20$ grading range, the random range of a weak student is $0-10$, of a fair student $4-16$, of a good student $8-20$, and of an excellent student $12-20$. The random grading generator follows in this case a double triangular probability law with \emph{mode} ($xm$) equal to the middle of the random range and median repartition ($r = 0.5$) of probability each side of the mode.

\end{lstlisting}
  
The example random tableau, generated for instance above with \texttt{missingData\-Proba\-bility} = $0.03$, \texttt{WithTypes} = \texttt{True} and \texttt{seed} = 100 (see List.~\vref{list:6.6} Lines~\ref{line:6.6.2}-\ref{line:6.6.5}), results in a set of two excellent (\texttt{s05e} and \texttt{s07e}), five good (\texttt{s02g}, \texttt{s03g}, \texttt{s06g}, \texttt{s09g} and \texttt{s10g}), three fair (\texttt{s01f}, \texttt{s04f} and \texttt{s08f}) and one weak (\texttt{s11w}) students. Notice that six students get a grade below the course validating threshold of $10$ and we observe four missing grades (\texttt{NA}), two in course \texttt{m5} and, one in courses \texttt{m3} and \texttt{m6} (see Lines~\ref{line:6.6.21}-\ref{line:6.6.31}).

A statistical summary of the students' grades obtained in the highest weighted course, namely \texttt{m7}, is shown with the \texttt{showCourseStatistics()} method. \index{showCourseStatistics@\texttt{showCourseStatistics()}}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Student performance summary statistics per course},label=list:6.7]
>>> t.showCourseStatistics('m7')
  *----- Summary performance statistics ------*
   Course name    : m7
   Course weight  : 5
   Students       : 11
   Grading scale  : 0.00 - 20.00
   Missing evaluations : 0
   Mean evaluation       : 12.82
   Standard deviation    : 3.79
   Maximal evaluation    : 18.00
   Quantile Q3 (x_75)    : 16.25
   Median evaluation     : 14.00
   Quantile Q1 (x_25)    : 10.50
   Minimal evaluation    : 6.00
   Mean absolute difference      : 4.30
   Standard difference deviation : 5.35
\end{lstlisting}

In Listing~\vref{list:6.7}, the Course \texttt{m7} evaluation statistics show a mean grade of $12.82$ and a median grade of $14$. Maximal (resp. minimal) grade is $18$ (resp. $6$).

\end{figure}
With a ranked heatmap view on all the grades we now get in Figure~\vref{fig:6.6} a global pictures of the performance of all the eleven students. The ranking shown here, produced with the \NetFlows ranking rule (see Sec.~\ref{sec:8.3}), reports a high correlation of $+0.887$ with the corresponding bipolar-valued outranking digraph (see Chap.~\ref{sec:16}).

The \NetFlows ranking represents also a rather \emph{fair weighted consensus} between the individual courses' marginal rankings as is made apparent with the \texttt{showRankingConsensusQuality()} method in Listing~\vref{list:6.8}.\index{showRankingConsensusQuality@\texttt{showRankingConsensusQua\-lity()}}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Consensus quality of the students's ranking},label=list:6.8]
>>> from outrankingDigraphs import\
...                  BipolarOutrankingDigraph
>>> g = BipolarOutrankingDigraph(t)
>>> t.showRankingConsensusQuality(\
...                 g.computeNetFlowsRanking())
  Consensus quality of ranking:
  ['s07', 's02', 's09', 's05', 's06', 's03', 's10',
   's01', 's08', 's04', 's11']
  Criterion (weight): correlation
  -------------------------------
     'm7' (0.294): +0.727
     'm4' (0.235): +0.309
     'm2' (0.059): +0.291
     'm3' (0.176): +0.200
     'm1' (0.118): +0.109
     'm6' (0.059): +0.091
     'm5' (0.059): +0.073
  Summary:
   Weighted mean marginal correlation (a): +0.361
   Standard deviation (b)                : +0.248
   Ranking fairness (a)-(b)              : +0.113
\end{lstlisting}

The correlation with the marginal course rankings follows precisely the order of the given ECTS weights. Course \texttt{m7}, with the highest relative weight ($0.294$) is most present ($+0.727$) in the global \NetFlows ranking and no marginal course ranking appears negatively correlated with this global ranking. The mean weighted correlation is $+0.361$.

Useful multiple-criteria ranking rules are presented and discussed in detail in Chapter~\ref{sec:8}. The next Chapter~\ref{sec:7} is concerned with yet another kind of performance evaluation models which is discussed in social choice theory, namely \emph{linear voting profiles}.
