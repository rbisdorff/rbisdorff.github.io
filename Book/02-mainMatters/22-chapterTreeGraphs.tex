\section{Generating random tree graphs}
\label{sec:22.1}

Using the \texttt{RandomTree} class\index{RandomTree@\texttt{RandomTree} class} from the \texttt{graphs} module, we may, for instance, generate a random tree graph with 9 vertices.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Generating a random tree graph},label=list:22.1]

\label{fig:22.1}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\vref{fig:22.1} one may notice that a tree graph of order $n > 2$ always contains $n-1$ edges (see Lines 7 and 8 in List.~\vref{list:22.1}) and its structure is entirely characterised by a corresponding \Pruefer \emph{code}, i.e. a list of vertices keys of length $n-2$. See, for instance in Line 15 the code \texttt{['v3'}, \texttt{'v8',} \texttt{'v8',} \texttt{'v3',} \texttt{'v7',} \texttt{'v6',} \texttt{'v7']} corresponding to our sample tree graph \texttt{rt}.

Each position of the code indicates the parent of the remaining leaf with the smallest vertex label. Vertex \texttt{v3} is thus the parent of \texttt{v1} and we drop leaf \texttt{v1}, \texttt{v8} is now the parent of leaf \texttt{v2} and we drop \texttt{v2}, vertex \texttt{v8} is again the parent of leaf \texttt{v4} and we drop \texttt{v4}, vertex \texttt{v3} is the parent of leaf \texttt{v5} and we drop \texttt{v5}, \texttt{v7} is now the parent of leaf \texttt{v3} and we may drop \texttt{v3}, \texttt{v6} becomes the parent of leaf \texttt{v8} and we drop \texttt{v8}, \texttt{v7} becomes the parent of leaf \texttt{v6} and we may drop \texttt{v6}. The two eventually remaining vertices, \texttt{v7} and \texttt{v9}, give the last link in the reconstructed tree \citep{JPB-1991}.  

It is, as well possible to, first, generate a random \Pruefer code of length $n-2$ from a set of $n$ vertices  (see List.~\vref{list:22.2} Lines 1-9 ) and then, construct the corresponding tree of order $n$ by reversing the procedure illustrated above. The resulting tree graph is shown in Fig.~\vref{fig:22.2}.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Generating a tree graph with a random \Pruefer code.},label=list:22.2]

\end{figure}

Following from the bijection between a labelled tree and its \Pruefer code, we actually know that there exist $n^{n-2}$ different tree graphs with the same $n$ vertices.

Given a genuine graph, how can we recognise that it is in fact a tree instance ?

\section{Recognising tree graphs}
\label{sec:22.2}

Given a graph \texttt{g} of order $n$ and size $s$, the following 5 assertions A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 are all equivalent (see \citep{JPB-1991}):
\begin{itemize}
\item [A1] \texttt{g} is a tree;
\item [A2] \texttt{g} is without (chordless) cycles and $n \,=\, s + 1$;
\item [A3] \texttt{g} is connected and $n \,=\, s + 1$;
\item [A4] Any two vertices of \texttt{g} are always connected by a unique path;
\item [A5] \texttt{g} is connected and dropping any single edge will always disconnect \texttt{g}.
\end{itemize}

Assertion A3, for instance, gives a simple test for recognising a tree graph. In case of a \emph{lazy evaluation} of the test in Listing~\vref{list:22.3} Line 3 below, it is opportune, from a computational complexity perspective, to first, check the order and size of the graph, before checking its potential connectedness. We provide the \texttt{isTree()} method\index{isTree@\texttt{isTree()}} for computing both these tests (see Line 8 in List.~\vref{list:22.3}).
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Recognizing a tree graph.},label=list:22.3]
>>> from graphs import RandomGraph
>>> g = RandomGraph(order=8,edgeProbability=0.3,seed=62)
>>> if g.order == (g.size +1) and g.isConnected():
...     print('The graph is a tree ?', True)
... else:
...     print('The graph is a tree ?',False)   
  The graph is a tree ? True
>>> g.isTree()
  True  
\end{lstlisting}
The random graph of order $8$ and edge probability $30\%$, generated with seed $62$, is actually a tree graph instance, as confirmed by its graphviz drawing shown in Fig.~\vref{fig:22.3}.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> g.exportGraphViz('test62')
  *---- exporting a dot file for GraphViz tools ---*
   Exporting to test62.dot
   fdp -Tpng test62.dot -o test62.png
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\sidecaption[t]
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Figures/22-3-test62.pdf}
\caption[Recognising a tree graph]{Recognising a tree graph. We may notice that vertex \texttt{v2} is actually situated in the \emph{centre} of the tree with a neighbourhood depth of 2} 
\label{fig:22.3}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

Yet, we still have to recover its corresponding \Pruefer code. Therefore, we may use the \texttt{tree2Pruefer()} method \index{tree2Pruefer@\texttt{tree2Pruefer()}} from the \texttt{TreeGraph} class. But, first, the instance class of graph \texttt{g} is changed to the \texttt{TreeGraph} type (see Line 2 in List.~\vref{list:22.4}). \index{TreeGraph@\texttt{TreeGraph()}}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Computing the \Pruefer code of a tree graph instance.},label=list:22.4]
>>> from graphs import TreeGraph
>>> g.__class__ = TreeGraph  
>>> g.tree2Pruefer()
  ['v6', 'v1', 'v2', 'v1', 'v2', 'v5']
\end{lstlisting}

In Fig.~\vref{fig:22.3}, we noticed that vertex \texttt{v2} is actually situated in the \emph{centre} of the tree with a neighbourhood depth of 2. Centres of a graph are the vertices with minimal neighbourhood depth. For finding such centre(s), the \texttt{Graph} class provides the \texttt{computeGraphCentres()} method.\index{computeGraphCentres@\texttt{computeGraphCentres()}} (see Lines 1-2 in List.~\vref{list:22.4}). Knowing now the centre of graph \texttt{g}, we may draw a correspondingly rooted and oriented tree with the \texttt{exportOrientedTreeGraphViz()} method from the \texttt{TreeGraph} class (see Fig.~\vref{fig:22.4}.\index{exportOrientedTreeGraphViz@\texttt{exportOrientedTreeGraphViz()}}  
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Computing the centres of a tree and drawing a rooted and oriented tree.},label=list:22.5]

  {'v2': 2}

Let us now turn our attention toward a major application of tree graphs, namely \emph{spanning trees} and \emph{forests} related to graph traversals.

\section{Spanning trees and forests}
\label{sec:22.2}

With the \texttt{RandomSpanningTree} class\index{RandomSpanningTree@\texttt{RandomSpanningTree} class} we may generate, from a given connected graph \texttt{g} instance, \emph{uniform} random instances of a spanning tree by using \Wilson's algorithm (see List.~\vref{list:22.6} and Fig.~\vref{fig:22.5}).
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Generating uniform random spanning trees.},label=list:22.6]
>>> from graphs import RandomGraph,\
...                    RandomSpanningTree
>>> g = RandomGraph(order=9,\
...                 edgeProbability=0.4,seed=100)

                       'dfs','date', 'dfsx',

\end{figure}

\Wilson's algorithm only works for connected graphs \citep{WIL-1996}. More general, and in case of a not connected graph, the \texttt{RandomSpanningForest} class\index{RandomSpanningForest@\texttt{RandomSpanningForest} class} generates a not necessarily uniform random instance of a \emph{spanning forest} --one or more random tree graphs-- generated from a random \emph{depth first search} of the graph components' traversals (see List.~\vref{list:22.7} and Fig.~\vref{fig:22.6}).
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Computing spanning forests over disconnected graphs. },label=list:22.7]

...                 edgeProbability=0.1,seed=140)

   {'v08','v03','v07'}, {'v15','v11','v10','v04','v05'},
   {'v09','v14'}]

     ['v15','v11','v04','v11','v15',

\section{Maximum determined spanning forests}
\label{sec:22.3}

In case of valued graphs --supporting weighted edges-- we may finally construct a \emph{most determined} spanning tree (or forest if not connected) using \Kruskal's greedy minimum-spanning-tree algorithm on the dual valuation of the graph \citep{KRU-1956}\footnote{\Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest.}.

In Listing~\vref{list:22.8} we generate, for instance, a randomly valued graph with five vertices and seven edges bipolar-valued in [-1.0; 1.0].\index{RandomValuationGraph@\texttt{RandomValuationGraph} class}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Generating randomly bipolar-valued graphs.},label=list:22.8]
>>> from graphs import RandomValuationGraph
>>> g = RandomValuationGraph(order=5,seed=2)
>>> g
  *------- Graph instance description ------*
   Instance class   : RandomValuationGraph
   Instance name    : randomGraph
   Graph Order      : 5
   Graph Size       : 7
   Valuation domain : [-1.00; 1.00]
   Attributes       : ['name', 'order',
                 'vertices', 'valuationDomain',
                 'edges', 'size', 'gamma']
\end{lstlisting}
To inspect the edges' actual weights, we first transform the graph into a corresponding digraph (see Line 1 in List.~\vref{list:22.9}) and use the \texttt{showRelationTable()} method (see Line 2) for printing its symmetric adjacency matrix. 
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Symmetric relation table},label=list:22.9]
>>> dg = g.graph2Digraph()
>>> dg.showRelationTable()
  *---- Relation Table -----
    S   |  'v1'	 'v2'  'v3'  'v4'  'v5'	  
   -----|------------------------------
   'v1' |  0.00	 0.91  0.90 -0.89 -0.83	 
   'v2' |  0.91	 0.00  0.67  0.47  0.34	 
   'v3' |  0.90	 0.67  0.00 -0.38  0.21	 
   'v4' | -0.89	 0.47 -0.38  0.00  0.21	 
   'v5' | -0.83	 0.34  0.21  0.21  0.00	 
   Valuation domain: [-1.00;1.00]
\end{lstlisting}

To compute the most determined spanning tree or forest, we can use the \texttt{Best\-DeterminedSpanningForest} constructor.\index{BestDeterminedSpanningForest@\texttt{BestDeterminedSpanningForest} class}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Computing best determined spanning forests.},label=list:22.10]
>>> from graphs import\
                BestDeterminedSpanningForest
>>> mt = BestDeterminedSpanningForest(g)
>>> print(mt)
  *------- Graph instance description ------*
   Instance class   : BestDeterminedSpanningForest
   Instance name    : bdSpanningForest
   Graph Order      : 5
   Graph Size       : 4
   Valuation domain : [-1.00; 1.00]
   Attributes       : ['name','vertices','order',
                       'valuationDomain',
                       'edges','size','gamma',
                       'dfs','date',
                       'averageTreeDetermination']
  *---- best determined spanning tree  ----*
   Depth first search path(s) :
   [['v1','v2','v4','v2','v5','v2','v1','v3','v1']]
   Average determination(s) : [Decimal('0.655')]
\end{lstlisting}

The random graph \texttt{g} is connected and, hence, admits a single spanning tree of maximum mean determination = $(0.47 + 0.91 + 0.90 + 0.34)/4 = 0.655$ (see Lines 9, 6 and 10 in List.~\vref{list:22.8} and Fig.~\vref{fig:22.7}).
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> mt.exportGraphViz(\
...      fileName='bestDeterminedspanningTree',\
...      WithSpanningTree=True)
  *---- exporting a dot file for GraphViz tools ---*
   Exporting to spanningTree.dot
   [['v4','v2','v1','v3','v1','v2','v5','v2','v4']]
   neato -Tpng bestDeterminedSpanningTree.dot\
         -o bestDeterminedSpanningTree.png
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{Best determined spanning tree} 
\label{fig:22.7}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

One may easily verify that all other potential spanning trees, including instead the edges \{\texttt{v3}, \texttt{v5}\} and/or \{\texttt{v4}, \texttt{v5}\}, will show a lower average determination.
