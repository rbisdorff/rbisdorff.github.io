This case study is inspired by a multiple criteria decision analysis case study published by Eisenführ Fr., Langer Th., and Weber M. \footnote{Eisenführ Fr., Langer Th., and Weber M. \emph{Fallstudien zu rationalem Entscheiden}, Springer 2001, pp. 1-17.}.

She would not mind staying in Köln, yet is ready to move elsewhere if necessary. The length of the higher studies do concern her, as she wants to earn her life as soon as possible.  Her parents however agree to financially support her study fees as well as her living costs during her studies.}

\section{The decision problem}
\label{sec:12.1}

Alice has already identified 10 potential study programs.

In Table \ref{tab:12.1} we notice that Alice considers three \emph{Graduate Interpreter} studies (8 or 9 Semesters), respectively in Köln, in Saarbrücken or in Heidelberg; and five \emph{Qualified translator} studies (8 or 9 Semesters), respectively in Köln, in Düsseldorf, in Saarbrücken, in Heidelberg or in Munich. She also considers two short (4 Semesters) study programs at the Chamber of Commerce in Köln. 

Four \textbf{decision objectives} of more or less equal importance are guiding Alice's choice:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{maximize} the attractiveness of the study place (GEO),
\item \emph{maximize} the attractiveness of her further studies (LEA),
\item \emph{minimize}  her financial dependency on her parents (FIN),
\item \emph{maximize} her professional perspectives (PRA).
\end{enumerate}

The decision consequences Alice wishes to take into account for evaluating the potential study programs with respect to each of the four objectives are modelled by the following \textbf{coherent family of criteria} \footnote{A coherent family of performance criteria verifies: a) \emph{Exhaustiveness}: No argument acceptable to all stakeholders can be put forward to justify a preference in favour of action $x$ versus action $y$  when $x$ and $y$ have the same performance level on each of the criteria of the family; b) \emph{Cohesiveness}: Stakeholders unanimously recognize that action $x$ must be preferred to action $y$ whenever the performance level of $x$ is significantly better than that of $y$ on one of the criteria of positive weight, performance levels of $x$ and $y$ being the same on each of the other criteria; c) \emph{Nonredundancy}: One of the above requirements is violated if one of the criteria is left out from the family. \emph{Source}: European Working Group \emph{Multicriteria Aid for Decisions}, Series 3, n.1, Spring, 2000.}.

Within each decision objective, the performance criteria are considered to be equisignificant. Hence, the four decision objectives show a same importance weight of 6 (see Table \ref{tab:12.2} Column 5).

\section{The performance tableau}
\label{sec:12.2}

The actual evaluations of Alice's potential study programs are stored in a file named \texttt{AliceChoice.py} of \texttt{PerformanceTableau} format \footnote{Alice's performance tableau \texttt{AliceChoice.py} is available in the \texttt{examples} directory of the \Digraph software collection}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Alice's performance tableau},label=list:12.1]
>>> from perfTabs import PerformanceTableau
>>> t = PerformanceTableau('AliceChoice')
>>> t.showObjectives()
  *------ decision objectives -------"
    GEO: Geographical aspect

     OP Occupational Prestige                     2
     Total weight: 6.00 (3 criteria)
\end{lstlisting}

Details of the performance criteria may be consulted in a browser view (see Fig. \ref{fig:12.2} below).

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> t.showHTMLCriteria()
\end{lstlisting}

\end{figure}

It is worthwhile noticing in Fig. \ref{fig:12.2} that, on her subjective attractiveness scale of the study programs (criterion $AS$), Alice considers a performance differences of 7 points to be \emph{considerable} and triggering, the case given, an outranking polarisation [BIS-2013]. Notice also the proportional \emph{indifference} ($1\%$) and \emph{preference} ($5\%$) discrimination thresholds shown on criterion $BC$-number of inhabitants.

Alice is subjectively evaluating the \emph{Attractiveness} of the studies (criterion $AS$) on an ordinal scale from 0 (weak) to 10 (excellent). Similarly, she is subjectively evaluating the \emph{Attractiveness} of the respective professions (criterion $AP$) on a three level ordinal scale from 0 (\emph{weak}), 1 (\emph{fair}) to 2 (\emph{good}). Considering the \emph{Occupational Prestige} (criterion $OP$), she looked up the SIOPS \footnote{Ganzeboom H.B.G, Treiman D.J. ``Internationally Comparable Measures of Occupational Status for the 1988 International Standard Classification of Occupations'', \emph{Social Science Research} 25, 201–239 (1996).}. All the other evaluation data she found on the internet (see Fig. \ref{fig:12.3}).

In the following \emph{heatmap view}, we may now consult Alice's performance evaluations.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> t.showHTMLPerformanceHeatmap(\
...       colorLevels=5,Correlations=True,ndigits=0)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[h]
\sidecaption
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{Figures/aliceHeatmap.png}
\caption{Heatmap of Alice's performance tableau}
\label{fig:12.3}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

Notice by the way that evaluations on performance criteria to be \emph{minimized}, like \emph{Distance to Home} (criterion $DH$) or \emph{Study time} (criterion \emph{SL}), are registered as \emph{negative} values, so that smaller measures are, in this case, preferred to larger ones.

Her ten potential study programs are ordered with the \NetFlows ranking rule applied to the corresponding bipolar-valued outranking digraph \footnote{See Section \ref{sec:8.3}.}. \emph{Graduate interpreter} studies in Köln ($I-FHK$) or Saarbrücken ($I-USB$), followed by \emph{Qualified Translator} studies in Köln ($T-FHK$) appear to be Alice's most preferred alternatives. The least attractive study programs for her appear to be studies at the Chamber of Commerce of Köln ($C-HKK$, $S-HKK$).

It is finally interesting to observe in Fig. \ref{fig:12.3} (third row) that the \emph{most significant} performance criteria, appear to be for Alice, on the one side, the \emph{Attractiveness} of the study program (criterion $AS$, tau = $+0.72$) followed by the \emph{Attractiveness} of the future profession (criterion $AP$, tau = $+0.62$). On the other side, \emph{Study times} (criterion $SL$, tau = $-0.24$), \emph{Big city} (criterion $BC$, tau = $-0.07$) as well as \emph{Monthly living costs} (criterion $LC$, tau = $-0.04$) appear to be for her  \emph{not so significant} \footnote{see Chapter \ref{sec:16}.}.


\section{Building a best choice recommendation}
\label{sec:12.3}

Let us now have a look at the resulting pairwise outranking situations.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Computing Alice's outranking digraph},label=list:12.2]
>>> from outrankingDigraphs import BipolarOutrankingDigraph
>>> dg = BipolarOutrankingDigraph(t) 
>>> dg
  *------- Object instance description ------*
   Instance class      : BipolarOutrankingDigraph
   Instance name       : rel_AliceChoice
   Actions             : 10

   Valuation domain    : [-1.00;1.00]
>>> dg.computeSymmetryDegree(Comments=True)
  Symmetry degree of graph <rel_AliceChoice> : 0.49
\end{lstlisting}

From Alice's performance tableau we obtain 67 positively validated pairwise outranking situations in the digraph $dg$, supported by a $74\%$ majority of criteria significance (see Listing \ref{list:12.2} Line 9-10).

Due to the poorly discriminating performance evaluations, nearly half of these outranking situations (see Line 12) are \emph{symmetric} and reveal actually \emph{more or less indifference} situations between the potential study programs. This is well illustrated in the \emph{relation map} of the outranking digraph (see Fig. \ref{fig:12.4}).

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> dg.showHTMLRelationMap(\
...           tableTitle='Outranking relation map',\
...           rankingRule='Copeland')
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{\Copeland ranked outranking relation map}
\label{fig:12.4}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

We have mentioned that Alice considers a performance difference of 7 points on the \emph{Attractiveness of studies} criterion $AS$ to be considerable which triggers, the case given, a potential polarisation of the outranking characteristics. In Fig. \ref{fig:12.4}, these polarisations appear in the last column and last row. We may inspect the occurrence of such polarisations as follows.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Polarised outranking situations},label=list:12.3]
>>> dg.showVetos()
    *----  Veto situations ---
    number of veto situations : 3 
    1: r(S-HKK >= I-FHK) = -0.17
     criterion: AS
     Considerable performance difference : -7.00
     Veto discrimination threshold       : -7.00
     Polarisation: r(S-HKK >= I-FHK) = -0.17 ==> -1.00
    2: r(S-HKK >= I-USB) = -0.17
     criterion: AS
     Considerable performance difference : -7.00
     Veto discrimination threshold       : -7.00
     Polarisation: r(S-HKK >= I-USB) = -0.17 ==> -1.00
    3: r(S-HKK >= I-UHB) = -0.17
     criterion: AS
     Considerable performance difference : -7.00
     Veto discrimination threshold       : -7.00
     Polarisation: r(S-HKK >= I-UHB) = -0.17 ==> -1.00
    *----  Counter-veto situations ---
    number of counter-veto situations : 3 
    1: r(I-FHK >= S-HKK) = 0.83
     criterion: AS
     Considerable performance difference : 7.00
     Counter-veto threshold              : 7.00
     Polarisation: r(I-FHK >= S-HKK) = 0.83 ==> +1.00
    2: r(I-USB >= S-HKK) = 0.17
     criterion: AS
     Considerable performance difference : 7.00
     Counter-veto threshold              : 7.00
     Polarisation: r(I-USB >= S-HKK) = 0.17 ==> +1.00
    3: r(I-UHB >= S-HKK) = 0.17
     criterion: AS
     Considerable performance difference : 7.00
     Counter-veto threshold              : 7.00
     Polarisation: r(I-UHB >= S-HKK) = 0.17 ==> +1.00
\end{lstlisting}

In Listing \ref{list:12.3}, we see that \emph{considerable} performance differences concerning the \emph{Attractiveness of the studies} ($AS$ criterion) are indeed observed between the \emph{Specialised Secretary} study programm offered in Köln and the \emph{Graduate Interpreter} study programs offered in Köln, Saarbrücken and Heidelberg. They polarise, hence, three \emph{more or less invalid} outranking situations to \emph{certainly invalid} (Lines 8, 13, 18) and corresponding three \emph{more or less valid} converse outranking situations to \emph{certainly valid} ones (Lines 25, 30, 35). 

We may finally notice in the relation map, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:12.4}, that the four best-ranked study programs, $I-FHK$, $I-USB$, $I-UHB$ and $T-FHK$,  are in fact \Condorcet winners (see Listing \ref{list:12.4} Line 2), i.e. they are all four \emph{indifferent} one of the other \textbf{and} positively \emph{outrank} all other alternatives, a result confirmed below by our best choice recommendation (Line 8).

     most credible action(s) = {'S-HKK': 0.17,'C-HKK': 0.17}
\end{lstlisting}
   
Most credible best choice among the four best-ranked study programs eventually becomes the \emph{Graduate Interpreter} study program at the Technical High School in Köln (see Listing \ref{list:12.4} Line 14) supported by a $(0.75 + 1)/2.0 \,=\,87.5\% (18/24)$ majority of global criteria significance \footnote{see Chapter \ref{sec:17}}.

In the relation map, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:12.4}, we see in the left lower corner that the \emph{asymmetric part} of the outranking relation, i.e. the corresponding \emph{strict} outranking relation, is actually \emph{transitive} (see Line 2 below). Hence, a \emph{graphviz} drawing of its \emph{skeleton}, oriented by the previous \emph{best}, respectively \emph{worst} choice, may well illustrate our \emph{best choice recommendation}.

Let us now, for instance, check the pairwise outranking situations observed between the first and second-ranked alternative, i.e. \emph{Garduate Interpreter} studies in Köln versus \emph{Graduate Interpreter} studies in Saabrücken (see $I-FHK$ and $I-USB$ in Fig. \ref{fig:12.3}).

In a similar way, we may finally compute a \emph{weak ranking} of all the potential study programs with the help of the \texttt{RankingByChoosingDigraph} constructor, who computes a bipolar ranking by conjointly \emph{best-choosing} and \emph{last-rejecting} [BIS-1999].

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Weakly ranking by bipolar best-choosing and last-rejecting},label=list:12.5]

	   4th last ranked ['T-UHB', 'T-USB']
	 3rd last ranked ['T-FHM']
       2nd last ranked ['C-HKK']
     1st last ranked ['S-HKK']
\end{lstlisting}

In Listing \ref{list:12.5}, we find confirmed that the \emph{Interpreter} studies appear all preferrred to the \emph{Translator} studies. Furthermore, the \emph{Interpreter} studies in Saarbrücken appear preferred to the same studies in Heidelberg. The Köln alternative is apparently the preferred one of all the \emph{Translater} studies. And, the \emph{Foreign Correspondent} and the \emph{Specialised Secretary} studies appear second-last and last ranked.

Yet, how \emph{robust} are our findings with respect to potential settings of the decision objectives' importance and the performance criteria significance?
		
\section{Robustness analysis}
\label{sec:12.4}

Alice considers her four decision objectives as being \emph{more or less} equally important. Here we have, however, allocated \emph{strictly equal} importance weights with \emph{strictly equi-significant} criteria per objective. How robust is our previous best choice recommendation when, now, we would consider the importance of the objectives and, hence, the significance of the respective performance criteria to be \emph{more or less uncertain}?

To answer this question, we will consider the respective criteria significance weights $w_j$ for $j=1,...,9$ to be \emph{triangular random variables} in the range 0 to $2w_j$ with mode = $w_j$. We may compute a corresponding $90\%$-\emph{confident} outranking digraph with the help of the \texttt{ConfidentBipolarOutrankingDigraph} constructor \footnote{see Chapter \ref{sec:18}}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Computing the 90\% confident outranking digraph},label=list:12.6]
>>> from outrankingDigraphs import\
...         ConfidentBipolarOutrankingDigraph

>>> cdg = ConfidentBipolarOutrankingDigraph(t,\
...         distribution='triangular',confidence=90.0)

>>> cdg
  *------- Object instance description ------*
    Instance class       : ConfidentBipolarOutrankingDigraph
    Instance name        : rel_AliceChoice_CLT
    Actions              : 10
    Criteria             : 9
    Size                 : 44
    Valuation domain     : [-1.00;1.00]
    Uncertainty model    : triangular(a=0,b=2w) 
    Likelihood domain    : [-1.0;+1.0] 
    Confidence level     : 90.0% 
    Confident majority   : 14/24 (58.3%) 
    Determinateness (%)  : 68.19
\end{lstlisting}

Of the original 67 valid outranking situations, we retain 44 outranking situations as being 90\%-confident (see Listing \ref{list:12.6} Line 13). The corresponding 90\%-*confident* \textbf{qualified majority} of criteria significance amounts to $14/24 = 58.3\%$ (Line 18).  

Concerning now a 90\%-confident best choice recommendation, we are lucky.

The \emph{Graduate Interpreter} studies in Köln remain indeed a 90\%-confident \Condorcet winner (see Fig. \ref{fig:12.7} Line 2). Hence, the same study program also remains our 90\%-confident most credible best choice supported by a continual $18/24 (87.5\%)$ majority of the global criteria significance (see Lines 9-10 and 16).

When previously comparing the two best-ranked study programs (see Fig. \ref{fig:12.6}), we have observed that $I-FHK$ actually positively outranks $I-USB$ on all four decision objectives. When admitting equi-significant criteria significances per objective, this outranking situation is hence valid independently of the importance weights Alice may allocate to each of her decision objectives. 

We may compute these \textbf{unopposed} outranking situations with help of the \texttt{UnOpposedBipolarOutrankingDigraph} constructor (see Section \ref{sec:19.5}).

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Computing the unopposed outranking situations},label=list:12.8]
>>> from outrankingDigraphs import UnOpposedBipolarOutrankingDigraph
>>> uop = UnOpposedBipolarOutrankingDigraph(t)
>>> uop
  *------- Object instance description ------*
    Instance class       : UnOpposedBipolarOutrankingDigraph
    Instance name        : AliceChoice_unopposed_outrankings

    Determinateness (%)  : 62.94
    Valuation domain     : [-1.00;1.00]
>>> uop.isTransitive()
  True
\end{lstlisting}

We keep 28 out the 67 standard outranking situations, which leads to an \emph{oppositeness degree} of $(1.0 - 28/67) = 58.21\%$ (see Listing \ref{list:12.8} Line 10). Remarkable furthermore is that this unopposed outranking digraph $uop$ is actually \emph{transitive}, i.e. modelling a \emph{partial ranking} of the study programs (Line 14).

We may hence make use of the \texttt{exportGraphViz()} method of the\\ \texttt{TransitiveDigraph} class for drawing the corresponding partial ranking.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> from transitiveDigraphs import TransitiveDigraph
>>> TransitiveDigraph.exportGraphViz(uop,\
...           fileName='choice_unopposed')
  *---- exporting a dot file for GraphViz tools ---------*

\caption{Unopposed partial ranking of the potential study programs. Again, when \emph{equi-signficant} performance criteria are assumed per decision objective, we observe in here that $I-FHK$ remains the stable best choice, \emph{independently} of the actual importance weights that Alice may wish to allocate to her four decision objectives.}

In view of her performance tableau in Fig. \ref{fig:12.3}, \emph{Graduate Interpreter} studies at the Technical High School Köln, thus, represent definitely \textbf{Alice's very best choice}.

For further reading about the \emph{Rubis Best Choice} methodology, one may consult in \cite{BIS-2015} the study of a \emph{real decision aid case} about choosing a best poster in a scientific conference.
