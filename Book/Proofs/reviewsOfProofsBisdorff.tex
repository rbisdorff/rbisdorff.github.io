\begin{quotation} \noindent Thank you very much for inspecting carefully the submitted manuscript. All AQs appear indeed justified and I propose below the necessary corrective actions. I have inserted some suggestions for minor corrections from my side.

\item [Preface AQ1] \emph{Drop the entire sentence:} \st{The required backward comptibility ... programming technique replaces.}
\item [Preface AQ2] \emph{Please change to:} The purpose of this book is to present in a single monograph the methodological and scientific contributions the author made over the past two decades to the multiple-criteria decision aiding field and that are either left unpublished or solely published in very specialised media difficult to access.
%---------
\item [Intro AQ3] Sentence OK
\item [Intro AQ4] \emph{Please change to:} We first notice its hybrid type: 
it is conjointly a multiple-criteria performance tableau and a bipolar-valued relation modelling outranking situations between the given performance records. Pairwise comparisons of decision alternatives and the recoding of the digraph characteristic valuation are then illustrated. 
\item [Intro AQ5] \emph{Please change to:} ... may deliver first, respectively last, choice recommendations.
% -------
\item [Figs List] Pages xxv - xxxii: \emph{Please list only the short versions (in square bracket) of the figures' captions}.
\item [Lists] Pages xxv - xl1: \emph{Including the long lists of figures and listings in the front matters of the book does not IMO seam suitable. This makes obvious sense in open access front matters for book promotion, yet appear cumbersome in the printed version.}

\item [Chap1 AQ1] OK \emph{for changing} List.\emph{ to} Listing \emph{all over the pages}.
\item [Chap1 AQ2] OK

\item [Chap2 AQ1] OK

  % -------
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\item [Chap3 AQ1] \emph{Please change to:}  From this property follows that a bipolar-valued outranking digraph verifies the \emph{coduality principle}\index{coduality principle}: the \emph{dual} (negation) of the \emph{converse} (transposition) of the outranking relation $(x \succsim y)$ corresponds to its asymmetric \emph{strict outranking} part $(x \succnsim y)$.

\item [Chap6 AQ1] \emph{Please change to:} Based on their grades obtained in a number of examinations, deciding which students validate or not their academic studies is the genuine decision practice of universities and academies. 
\item [Chap6 AQ2] OK

  % ------

\item [Chap12 AQ1] \emph{Please move citation} (Fig. 12.1) \emph{in Line 16 on page} 151 \emph{to Line} 19 \emph{on page} 152: Alice ... wants to start her further studies thereafter (Fig. 12.1). She ...

\item [Chap13 AQ1] \emph{Listing 13.1 caption} = \{Performance tableau of the 75 first-ranked academic Institutions\} 
\item [Chap13 AQ1] \emph{Please change to:} Showing many incomparabilities and indifferences, not being transitive and containing many robust outranking circuits make that no ranking algorithm, applied to digraph \texttt{rdg}, does exist that would produce a unique optimal linear ranking result.
\item [Chap13 AQ3] OK

  % ------
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\item [Chap14 AQ1] \emph{Please change to:} Let us conclude this hypothetical rating case study, by saying that we prefer this latter rating-by-sorting approach. It is perhaps providing a less preciser rating result, due the case given, to missing and contradictory performance data. Yet, the rating-by-sorting algorithm is better grounded in a powerful bipolar-valued logic and epistemic framework.

\item [Chap16 AQ1] \emph{Please change to:} Listing 16.9 Line 2 illustrates first how to compute, with the \texttt{NetFlowsOrder} class from the \texttt{linearOrders} module, the global \textsc{Netflows} ranking \texttt{nf}, as shown in the ordered heatmap of Fig. 16.2 on page 213. In Lines 8-27 we compute subsequently the bipolar-valued relational equivalence index between each one of the individual criticâ€™s star-ratings and the \texttt{nf} ranking.
