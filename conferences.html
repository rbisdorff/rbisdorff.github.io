Distinguished <a href="https://wwwen.uni.lu/recherche/fstc/interdisciplinary_lab_for_intelligent_and_adaptive_systems_ilias/" target="_blank">ILIAS</a> <em>Interdisciplinary Lab for Intelligent and Adaptive Systems</em> Lecture IV, FSTC, University of Luxembourg, 3 May, 2017 (handout: <a href="documents/adtIntro-2x2.pdf" target="_blank">PDF file 1.1 MB</a>).</p>
    <p class="abstract">
        <em class="abstract">Today's decision makers in fields ranging from engineering to psychology, from medicine to economics and/or homeland security are faced with remarkable new technologies, huge amounts of information to help them in reaching good decisions, and the ability to share information at unprecedented speeds and quantities. These tools and resources should lead to better decisions. Yet, the tools bring with them daunting new problems: the massive amounts of data available are often incomplete, unreliable and/or distributed and there is great uncertainty in them; interoperating/distributed decision makers and decision making devices need to be coordinated; many sources of data need to be fused into a good decision; information sharing under new cooperation/competition arrangements raises security problems. When faced with such issues, there are few highly efficient algorithms available to support decision makers. The objective of Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT) is to improve the ability of decision makers to perform well when facing these new challenges and problems through the use of methods from theoretical computer science, in particular algorithmic methods. The primary goal of ADT is hence to explore and develop algorithmic approaches for solving decision problems arising in a variety of applications areas. Examples include, but are not limited to:<br/><a name="2016"></a>
- Computational tractability/intractability of social consensus and multiple criteria compromise functions;<br/>
- Improvement of decision support and recommender systems;<br/>
- Development of automatic decision devices including on-line decision procedures;<br/>
- Robust decision making;<br/>
- Learning for multi-agent systems and other on-line decision devices.<br/>
This presentation will focus more specifically on multiple criteria decision aiding methodology, the actual research field of the author.</em>

        <em class="abstract">We illustrate in this presentation a sparse HPC implementation for outranking digraphs of huge orders, up to several millions of decision alternatives. The proposed outranking digraph model is based on a quantiles equivalence class decomposition of the underlying multicriteria performance tableau. When locally ranking each of these ordered components, we may readily obtain an overall linear ranking of big sets of decision alternatives. For the local rankings, both, Copeland's as well as the Net-Flows ranking rules, appear to give  the best compromise between, on the one side, the fitness of the overall ranking with respect to the given global outranking relation and, on the other side, computational tractability for very big outranking digraphs modelling up to several trillions of pairwise outranking situations.</em>

    <p class="abstract">
        <em class="abstract">Several ranking methods, like Tideman's rule, have been proposed for ranking decision actions with multiple incommensurable performance criteria. Of these, Kohler's rule is by far the fastest ranking heuristic, yet also the less satisfactory in terms of ordinal correlation with a corresponding pairwise outranking relation. We show that preordering the decision actions to be ranked along quantiles, and then locally applying Kohler's rule on each equivalence class, greatly enhances this correlation without adding any essential algorithmic complexity. The combination of both, hence, becomes efficient for tackling large scale multiple criteria ranking problems. </em>

    <p>R. Bisdorff, <em>On confident outrankings with multiple criteria of uncertain significance</em>. <a href="https://www.lgi.ecp.fr/~mousseau/DA2PL-2014/pmwiki.php" target="_blank">DA2PL'2014</a> from Multiple Criteria Decision Aid to Preference Learning, Ecole Centrale Paris, 20-21 November, 2014 (see <a href="https://www.lgi.ecp.fr/~mousseau/DA2PL-2014/pmwiki.php/Main/Program" target="_blank">Programme</a>, downladable presentation: <a href="documents/da2plRB-2x2.pdf">PDF file 479.8 kB</a>). </p>
    <p class="abstract">
        <em class="abstract">When modelling preferences following the outranking approach, the sign of the majority margins do sharply distribute validation and invalidation of pairwise outranking situations. How can we be confident in the resulting outranking digraph, when we acknowledge the usual imprecise knowledge of criteria significance weights and a small majority margin? To answer this question, we propose to model the significance weights as random variables following more less widespread distributions around an average weight value that corresponds to the given deterministic weight. As the bipolarly valued random credibility of an outranking statement results from a simple sum of positive or negative independent and similarly distributed random variables, we may apply the CLT for computing likelihoods that a given majority margin is indeed positive, respectively negative. To test the effective convergence of the CLT likelihoods, we apply Monte Carlo simulations of outranking digraph constructions. Our computational results confirm a satisfactory convergence even for a random performance tableau with only seven criteria. </em>

    <p class="abstract">
        <em class="abstract">Ranking-by-choosing decision alternatives with possibly a small number of ties, when dealing with pairwise bipolarly-valued outranking situations, is a computational difficult problem that could until now only be genuinely solved for tiny outranking digraph orders; up to 40 alternatives. In this lecture we present a HPC two-stages decomposition of large outranking digraphs, which allows us to solve such ranking-by-choosing problems for larger outranking digraph orders; up to several thousands of decision alternatives. In a first stage, all alternatives are sorted into a prefixed set of multiple criteria quantile classes. Each resulting quantile equivalence class is then, in a second stage, locally ranked-by-choosing on the basis of the restricted outranking digraph. Operational results will be illustrated with Monte Carlo simulations of large scale Cost-Benefit performance tableaux. </em>

    <p class="abstract">
        <em class="abstract"><a name="2013"/>Polarised outrankings with considerable performance differences (weighted majority margins with vetoes and counter-vetoes) appear as weakly complete (and reflexive) relations (Bisdorff 2013). Constructing weak orderings (rankings with potential ties) from such outranking relations consists in computing, hence, a transitive closure of the given outranking relation. Determining optimal transitive closures is a computational difficult problem ( (Hudry 2013). However, global heuristic scoring methods based on average ranks (like Borda scores) or average net flows like in the PROMETHEE approach, may easily deliver such a transitive closure. Now, weak orderings may also naturally result from the iterated application of a certain choice procedure, an approach called "ranking-by-choosing" (Bouyssou 2004). In this contribution we shall present such a new ranking-by-choosing approach based on the Rubis best choice method (Bisdorff et al. 2008). A practical application concerns the weak ordering of 41 German universities following from the Spiegel magazine's on-line 50000 students survey from 2004 (see <a href="https://charles-sanders-peirce.uni.lu/bisdorff/documents/studentenSpiegelxmcda2.xml" target="-blank">survey data</a> and <a href="https://charles-sanders-peirce.uni.lu/bisdorff/documents/studentenSpiegelRanking.pdf" target="_blank">final ranking</a>).</em>

        <p class="abstract">In the context of Multiple Criteria Decision Aid, a decision-maker may be faced at any time with the task of analysing one or several
sets of alternatives, irrespective of the decision he is about to make. As in this case the alternatives may express contrasting gains and losses on the criteria on which they are evaluated, and while the sets that are presented to the decision-maker may potentially be large, the task of analysing them becomes a difficult one. Therefore the need to reduce these sets to a more concise representation is very important. Classically, profiles that describe sets of alternatives may be found in the context of the sorting problem, however they are either given beforehand by the decision-maker or determined from a set of assignment examples. We would therefore like to extend such profiles, as well as propose new ones, in order to characterise any set of alternatives. For each of them, we present several approaches for extracting them, which we then compare with respect to their performance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We shortly present first the field of multiple criteria decision aid and its preference modelling tradition, before introducing clustering procedures that group decision alternatives, not on the basis of their similarity or dissimilarity, but, instead, on the basis of their being indifferent or not. In order to illustrate the approach, we present a real large scale case study that concerns preferential clustering of 22000 toxic chemicals release practices in the US.</p>

        <em class="abstract">There is a need to change from systems thinking to infrastructural thinking about decision support systems (DSSs). Decision makers (citizens, policy makers, business managers) do not benefit nor add value to the data and data infrastructures on Inter/intranet because of lack of DSS Infrastructure (DSSI). Reasons are heterogeneity and non-interoperability, lack of standards and easily reconfigurable and adaptable DSSs as well as scattered scientific and industrial communities. Main objectives of the new COST Action are: <br />
- to support development of new distributed inter-operable DSSI (e.g. standards, policies, ontologies, opensource software, discovery and work flow tools), and <br />
- to develop decision fusion and aiding methodologies especially for spatial data handling, and easily scalable and interoperable DSSs,<br /> 
- and to link dispersed research and practice communities.<br />
Benefits are an integrated European development of DSSI, and fair conditions for industry to add value to data for decision makers.</em>

<p class="abstract">
<em class="abstract">In this presentation we develop an indirect approach for assessing criteria significance weights from the robustness of the significance that a decision maker acknowledges for his pairwise outranking statements in a Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding process. The main result consists in showing that with the help of a mixed integer linear programming model this kind of a priori knowledge is sufficient for estimating adequate numerical significance weights.</em></a></p>

<p class="abstract"><em class="abstract">XMCDA is a structured XML proposal for encoding objects and data from the field of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). Its main objectives are to allow different MCDA algorithms to interact and to be easily callable from within a common software platform like Decision Deck diviz.

Comparison with standard random digraphs illustrates the specific characteristics of genuine outranking digraphs. Our results are meaningful for discussing algorithmic complexity issues when exploiting outranking relations for selecting, ranking and sorting decision problems.</em></a></p>
