            <em>We present in this paper a sparse HPC implementation for outranking digraphs of huge orders, up to several millions of decision alternatives. The proposed outranking digraph model is based on a quantiles equivalence class decomposition of the underlying multicriteria performance tableau. When locally ranking each of these ordered components, we may readily obtain an overall linear ranking of big sets of decision alternatives. For the local rankings, both, Copeland's as well as the Net-Flows ranking rules, appear to give  the best compromise between, on the one side, the fitness of the overall ranking with respect to the given global outranking relation and, on the other side, computational tractability for very big outranking digraphs modelling up to several trillions of pairwise outranking situations.

            <em>Cloud service providers (CSPs) offer different Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to the cloud users. Cloud Service Brokers (CSBs) provide multiple sets of alternatives to the cloud users according to users requirements. Generally, a CSB considers the service commitments of CSPs rather than the actual
quality of CSPs services. To overcome this issue, the broker should verify the service performances while recommending cloud services to the cloud users, using all available data. In this paper, we compare our two approaches to do so: a min-max-min decomposition based on Intuitionistic Fuzzy Logic (IFL) and a Performance Heat Map technique, to evaluate the performance of commercially available cloud providers. While the IFL technique
provides simple, total order of the evaluated CSPs, Performance Heat Map provides transparent and explanatoy, yet consistent evaluation of service performance of commercially available CSPs. The identified drawbacks of the IFL technique are: 1) It does not return the accurate performance evaluation overmultiple decision alternatives due to highly influenced by critical feedback of the evaluators; 2) Overall ranking of the CSPs is
not as expected according to the performance measurement. As a result, we recommend to use performance Heat Map for this problem.

            <em>Selecting the appropriate cloud services and cloud providers according to the cloud users requirements is becoming a complex task, as the number of cloud providers increases. Cloud providers offer similar kinds of cloud services, but they are different in terms of price, quality of service, customer experience, and service delivery. The most challenging issue of the current cloud computing business is that cloud providers commit a certain Service Level Agreement (SLA), with cloud users, but there is little or no verification mechanisms which ensure that cloud providers are providing cloud services according to their commitment. In the current literature, there is a lack of an evaluation model which provides the real status of cloud providers for the cloud users. In this paper, an evaluation model is proposed, which verifies the quality of cloud services delivered for each service and provides the service status of the cloud providers. Finally, evaluation results obtained from cloud auditors are visualized in an ordered performance heat map, showing the cloud providers in a decreasing ordering of overall service quality. In this way, the proposed service quality evaluation model represents a visual recommender system for cloud service brokers and cloud users.

            <em>This book illustrates the rich diversity of aspects which is typical of multiple criteria decision problems. Decision aiding is a process. As such, it involves a series of actors (decision maker(s), stakeholders, experts, analysts, etc.); interaction and feedback play a crucial role. The activity of modelling the problem and the decision maker’s preferences is more important and time consuming than the more technical part consisting in choosing and applying a method for aggregating the decision maker’s (DM’s) preferences. Formulating a recommendation to the DM is also a delicate part of the process. The study of decision aiding processes is a research domain in itself, in which there is still much work to be done. In particular, a detailed and operational description of this sort of process is required in view of building computerized decision aiding systems that could help analysts to monitor such processes. The fifteen MCDA applications that are studied in this book describe examples of such decision aiding processes. In view of emphasizing their salient features, an individual editors’ commentary is added to each application chapter. A common line of critical reviewing guidelines was therefore developed. The eventually chosen template for structuring these commentaries identifies five major aspects: application context, problem structuring, performance evaluation modelling, decision aiding process, tangibility and practical impact of results. The editors hope that the case studies of MCDA applications gathered in this book may hence contribute to validate the general framework and permit to deepen the analysis of decision aiding processes, as a step towards the implementation of decision aiding monitoring systems.

            <em>In the context of Multiple Criteria Decision Aid, a decision-maker may be faced at any time with the task of analysing one or several sets of alternatives, irrespective of the decision he is about to make. As in this case the alternatives may express contrasting gains and losses on the criteria on which they are evaluated, and while the sets that are presented to the decision-maker may potentially be large, the task of analysing them becomes a difficult one. Therefore the need to reduce these sets to a more concise representation is very important. Classically, profiles that describe sets of alternatives may be found in the context of the sorting problem, however they are either given beforehand by the decision-maker or determined from a set of assignment examples. We would therefore like to extend such profiles, as well as propose new ones, in order to characterise any set of alternatives. For each of them, we present several approaches for extracting them, which we then compare with respect to their performance.</em></p><br/></div>

In this paper we discuss the clustering of the set of criteria in a multicriteria decision analysis. Our approach is based on a generalisation of Kendall's rank correlation index resulting in the definition of a bipolar ordinal correlation index. A factorial decomposition of this index allows to compute the principal inertia planes of the criteria correlations. The same ordinal correlation index, modelling a symmetric bipolar-valued similarity digraph, allows us to compute a criteria clustering from its maximal cliques.</em>

The main concern of this article is to present the RUBIS method for tackling the choice problem in the context of multiple criteria decision aiding. Its genuine purpose is to help a decision maker to determine a single best decision alternative. Methodologically we focus on pairwise comparisons of these alternatives which lead to the concept of bipolar-valued outranking digraph. The work is centred around a set of five pragmatic principles which are required in the context of a progressive decision aiding methodology. Their thorough study and implementation in the outranking digraph lead us to define a choice recommendation as an extension of the classical digraph kernel concept.</em>

<em class="abstract">Minimal independent and outranking or outranked choices, i.e. kernels, in valued outranking digraphs are an essential formal tool for solving best unique choice problems in the context of our multicriteria decision aid methodology. It appears, following recent formal results, that computing these kernels may rely on the enumeration of all kernels observed in the associated crisp median cut outranking digraph. Knowing these crisp kernels allows one to compute the associated bipolar-valued kernel via the fixpoints of the kernel bipolar-valued characteristic equation systems. In this article we shall therefore, first,  present the bipolar-valued concepts of outranking digraphs and independent outranking and outranked choices, each associated with their corresponding median cut crisp concept. In a second section, we shall then discuss general algorithms for enumerating crisp outranking and/or outranked choices in a bipolar-valued digraph. A third section will be devoted to extending these algorithms in order to compute the corresponding bipolar-valued choices. </em></a></p>

<em class="abstract">In multicriteria decision aid methodology, and more particularly in the outranking methods, the problem of aggregating preference statements along multiple points of view is commonly solved with the help of cardinal weights translating the importance the decision maker gives each point of view. However, determining the exact numerical values of these weights remains one of the most obvious practical difficulties in applying outranking methods. To cope with the difficulty of measuring the exact numerical importance of each point of view in a given decision problem, we extend in a first section the majority concordance principle -- as implemented in the ELECTRE methods -- to the context where merely ordinal information concerning the relative weights of the criteria is available. Basic data and notation is introduced and the classical outranking concept is adapted to our purpose. The ordinal concordance principle is formally introduced and illustrated on a simple car selection problem. In a second section, we address the theoretical foundation of our definition of ordinal concordance. In addition, an operational test for assessing the truthfulness of an ordinally concordant outranking statement is developed. The core approach involves the construction of a distributional dominance test similar in its design to the stochastic dominance approach. In a third section we finally address the general robustness problem of valued outranking statements. Classical dominance, i.e. unanimous concordance, ordinal as well as simple majority concordance, are considered altogether in a common logical framework in order to achieve robust optimal choice recommendations. We rely in this approach on recent work of us on good choices methodology from ordinal valued outranking relations.</em></a></p>

<em class="abstract">L'objet de cette &eacute;tude est de construire une recommandation de choix des meilleurs objets au sein d'un ensemble d'objets (appel&eacute;s parfois actions potentielles) sur lequel on a d&eacute;fini une relation de surclassement de type <i>pr&eacute;f&eacute;rence, indiff&eacute;rence, incomparabilit&eacute;</i>. Lorsque la recommandation se r&eacute;sume &agrave; un meilleur objet unique on parle de <i>choix final d'une seule meilleure action</i> (cf. B. Roy et  D. Bouyssou, 1993). De nombreuses approches existent pour d&eacute;finir un tel sous-ensemble et parmi elles ,celle inspir&eacute;e de la th&eacute;orie des jeux et propos&eacute;e en 1944,  par J. von Neumann et O. Morgenstern.  Ils retiennent un ensemble int&eacute;rieurement stable ou simplement stable (les objets retenus sont incomparables entre eux) et ext&eacute;rieurement stable ou dominant (un objet non retenu est surclass&eacute; par au moins un des objets retenus).  J. Riguet (1948) donne &agrave; ce concept de double stabilit&eacute; int&eacute;rieure et ext&eacute;rieure le nom de noyau. B. Roy utilise &eacute;galement cette approche dans un contexte d'aide multicrit&egrave;re &agrave; la d&eacute;cision et propose de consid&eacute;rer comme recommandation du meilleur choix unique les actions du noyau du graphe induit par la relation de surclassement (graphe de surclassement). La difficult&eacute; de mise en &oelig;uvre de cette proc&eacute;dure de s&eacute;lection r&eacute;side en la possible vacuit&eacute; ou multiplicit&eacute; des noyaux dues &agrave; la pr&eacute;sence &eacute;ventuelle de circuits non transitifs. Dans ce cas, il est alors propos&eacute; de partitionner le graphe de surclassement en  circuits maximaux et de rendre &eacute;quivalentes toutes les actions du circuit en r&eacute;duisant tout ou partie de ces circuits &agrave; une seule classe d'&eacute;quivalence (ELECTRE I). On peut &eacute;galement envisager d'augmenter la diff&eacute;renciation des actions en supprimant certaines relations de surclassement de mani&egrave;re &agrave; assurer la rupture d'un circuit (ELECTRE IS). La contraction ou la rupture de circuits (guid&eacute;e par un indicateur de robustesse) permet ainsi d'obtenir un noyau unique, c'est-&agrave;-dire une recommandation de meilleur choix unique, qui peut en plus &ecirc;tre facilement construite gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la mise en ordre des sommets du graphe, dans ce cas assur&eacute;e. Notre approche retient &eacute;galement le concept de noyau pour d&eacute;finir une recommandation de meilleur choix unique. Cependant elle est originale par le fait qu'elle prend en compte &agrave; la fois <i>les  bonnes actions</i> (sous-ensembles stables et dominants) et <i>les mauvaises actions</i>, c'est-&agrave;-dire les sous-ensembles stables et absorbants (un objet non retenu surclasse au moins un des objets consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme mauvaises actions). N'ayant pas &agrave; recourir &agrave; la r&eacute;duction des circuits maximaux en classes pr&eacute;sum&eacute;es d'ex aequo ou &agrave; la rupture de circuits, notre approche &eacute;vite les modifications plus ou moins arbitraires du graphe de  surclassement donn&eacute;.</em></a></p>

<em class="abstract">We consider extensions of some classical rational axioms introduced in conventional choice theory to valued preference relations. The concept of kernel is revisited using two ways: one proposes to determine kernels with a degree of qualification and the other presents a fuzzy kernel where every element of the support belongs to the rational choice set with a membership degree. Links between the two approaches is emphasized. We exploit these results in Multiple-attribute Decision Aid to determine the good and bad choices. All the results are valid if the valued preference relations are evaluated on an ordinal scale.</em></a></p>

<em class="abstract">The EURO working group on Human Centered Processes
(HCP) aims at placing human beings at the center of future development
of the knowledge-based society, and more specifically at studying
operational strategies and processes used by people in professional
contexts. The focus of the 14th Mini-EURO Conference was on distributed
decision making and human-machine cooperation. An extensive refereeing
process resulted in the selection of 47 individual research papers. Our
three distinguished guest speakers were Professors Peter Todd, Paul
Slovic, and Ola Svenson. Collectively, the three plenary sessions
provided a comprehensive view of the state of the art in decision
making research. Altogether, the authors represent at least 21
countries and four continents: Algeria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico,
The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine,
United Kingdom, and United States of America. In addition, the program
contained two practitioner panels focusing on critical decision making:
one on military applications, and the second on human-machine
cooperation in aviation. Both panels consisted of domain practitioners
and academics specializing in the respective fields. We also devote one
regular presentation session to critical decision making. Here, the
contributions of Debernard, Cr&eacute;vitz and Millot and Fields and Amaldi
focus on air traffic control issues, whereas that of Kersten,
Michalowski and Wilk addresses triage support for mobile clinical
systems. <br />
The individual sessions ranged from the very
specific to the broad and fundamental. The presentations fall into five
general categories: In-depth modeling of specific problem areas (Agent
Modeling, Annualized Work Time, and Visualization in Large Databases),
Applications (Industrial and New Technology), Basic Concepts and Theory
(Communities of Practice, Complex Systems, and Contextual Knowledge),
Distributed Collaborative/Decision Systems/Learning, and Methods (Data
Mining, Heuristics, Mathematical Approaches to HCP, and Novel Methods).
<br />

Within the <i>in-depth modeling of specific problem
areas</i> grouping, Ferraris, Fioretti, and Remondino focus on key aspects
of agent modeling; Azmat and Widmer, Chan, Zemmouri and Weill, and
Corominas and Lusa on annualized work time modeling; and Noirhomme,
Thanh-Nghi and Poulet, and Noy and Schroeder on visualization
techniques in large databases.<br />  

Two sessions are devoted to <i>industrial and new
technology applications</i>, respectively. The contribution by Thibault,
Lanouette, Fonteix, Kiss, and Zaras addresses decision making applied
to a high yield pulping process. Escobar-Toledo and L&oacute;pes-Garc&iacute;a
present a model for assigning maintenance priorities in an oil
production setting. Habbi and Zelmat develop a drum boiler linguistic
model for complexity reduction and interpretability improvement. The
presentations in the new technology grouping consist of a ethical
multi-criteria decision support web-based system (Kaklauskas,
Zavadskas, Kaklauskiene, and Trinkunas), a simulation of a smart
wheelchair in a virtual scene (Niniss and Nadif), and a framework for
assessing the impact of new technology in sports annotation (Kilner,
Trepess, Economou, Jennings and Winter). <br />

The <i>basic concepts and theory</i> grouping consists
of three quite varied components: communities of practice, complex
systems, and contextual knowledge. Figueiro discusses collaborative
platforms and distributed decision in the public sector. Dargam and
Barnhart take steps toward decision support systems for planning
distance learning. Huis in't Veld, Soekijad and Enserink explore
learning in inter-organizational communities of practice. Within the
complex systems grouping, M&uuml;ller-Merbach discusses challenges of
self-leadership, and DeTombe complex issues associated with large
cities. Finally, the role of contextual knowledge on decision making is
discussed by Br&eacute;zillon, Pomerol and Br&eacute;zillon, and Lundberg. Here, the
discussion will center on contextual graphs, the proceduralization of
contextual knowledge, and the spontaneous emergence of context,
respectively.<br />

The contributions in the <i>distributed
collaborative/decision systems</i> grouping address collaborative learning
(Grosjean, Pudelko and Henri, Hautecouverture, Gr&eacute;gori, Charoy, Godart,
Patten, and Faugeras, and Heraud), distributive collaborative systems
(Louren&ccedil;o and Costa, Melo and Costa, and Antunes, Melo, and Costa), and
distributed decision systems (Gachet and Haettenschwiller, Coppin and
Skryzniarz, and Papamichail and Robertson). The varied contributions
address collaborative distance learning, share and re-use experience in
training, public participation in support systems, the collaboration
studio, the differences and similarities between individual and
distributed decision aids, and alternative generation and screening in
distributed decision processes.<br />

Finally, four important sessions are devoted to
methodology: <i>data mining, heuristics, mathematical approaches to HCP,
and novel methods</i>. Vaillant, Picouet and Lenca present a platform for
rule quality benchmarking; Blanchard, Guillet and Briand develop a
virtual reality environment for knowledge mining; and Boniver and Meyer
explore market investigation and knowledge acquisition through data
observation. Within the heuristics sub-grouping, Papamichail applies
the k-means range algorithm to personalized data clustering in
e-commerce; Ridwan's non-shortest paths route choice model is based on
fuzzy preference relations; whereas Schweigert applies a fuzzy-based
expert system to management by exception. The sub-group of mathematical
approaches to HCP contains contributions by Labreuche and Grabisch and
Marichal, addressing the Choquet integral's applicability to ratio
scales and aggregation, and by Koshlai and Mikhalevich who present a
hierarchical procedure aiding human expertise. Finally, under the novel
methods umbrella, De Smets presents multicriteria auctions, Janetzko
the case of Bayesian networks for user modeling, and Labreuche and
Grabisch the importance of bi-cooperative games.

First, we introduce the clustering problem, then we briefly sketch the concept

<em class="abstract">In this chapter, we show Bernard Roy's
contribution to modern computational logic. Therefore we first present his
logical approach for multicriteria preference modelling. Here, decision aid is
based upon a refined methodological construction, that provides the family of
criteria with important logical properties giving access to the concordance
principle used for aggregating preferential assertions from multiple semiotical
points of view. In a second section, we introduce the semiotical foundation of
the concordance principle and present a new formulation of the concordance
principle with its associated necessary coherence axioms imposed on the family
of criteria. This new methodological framework allows us, in a third part, to
extend the classical concordance principle and its associated coherence axioms
imposed on the family of criteria first, to potentially redundant criteria,
but also to missing individual evaluations and even partial performance tableaux.</em></a></p>

<em class="abstract">The actual development of the SODAS software based on symbolic data
analysis as extensively described in the previous chapters of this book
was accompanied by a series of benchmark activities involving some
official statistical institutes throughout Europe. Partners in these
benchmark activities were the National Statistical Institute (INE) of
Portugal, the Instituto Vasco de Estadistica Euskal (EUSTAT) from
Spain, the Office For National Statistics (ONS) from the United
Kingdom, the Inspection G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la S&eacute;curit&eacute; Sociale (IGSS) from
Luxembourg and marginally the University of Athens. <br/>
The principal goal of these benchmark activities was to eventually
demonstrate usefulness of symbolic data analysis for practical
statistical exploitation and analysis of official statistical data. <br/>
This chapter aims to briefly report from these activities by presenting
some significant insights onto practical results obtained by the
benchmark partners in using the SODAS software package as described in
chapter 14 below. <br/>
Our editorial criteria for compiling the illustrative examples of this
chapters are as follows: - First, we aim at readability of the examples
for general statisticians not necessarily working in a national
official statistical institute; - A second framing aspect was
externally given to us by the at that time available SODAS software
package in the sense that all hereafter discussed statistical results
were obtained by a practical application of the at that time released
version 1.031 of the SODAS workbench. <br/>
The chapter is divided into three parts: - First we present the results
obtained in the context of social security statistics where
professional careers of retired working persons from Luxembourg are
analysed with the help of the SODAS software. - A second illustrative
example relates some results obtained from a common exploitation and
analysis of the labour force survey provided by EUSTAT and INE. This
example tends to show usefulness of the symbolic data analysis for
joining statistical results from different statistical institutes as is
common in the European Union at the level of EUROSTAT. - Finally, a
last example concerns processing of ONS Census data.</em></a></p>

<em class="abstract">The need to extract new knowledge from complex data
contained in relational databases is increasing. Therefore, it becomes
a task of first importance to summarise huge data sets by their
underlying concepts in order to extract useful knowledge. These
concepts can only be described by more complex data type called
''symbolic data''. We define ''Symbolic Data Analysis'' (SDA) as the
extension of standard Data Analysis to symbolic data tables. The
''Symbolic Data Analysis'' theory is now enhanced by a new software
tool called ''SODAS'' which results from the effort of 17 European
teams (sponsored by EUROSTAT). This is shown by several applications in
Official Statistics.</em></a></p>
